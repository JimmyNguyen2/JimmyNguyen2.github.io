					<h1>Something about Jimmy:<h1>
					<p><h3>I am a Senior Software Engineer. I am best known for my attention to detail, strong work ethic, and desire to improve myself.</h3><p>
					<p><h3>Most recently I worked at St. Jude Medical, where I was responsible for working with requirement and development engineers to decide the best strategy to test the application. I worked closely with developers to solve issues and created automatic and manual tests using C#. I also reported project status to the project manager.</h3></p>
					<p><h3>I led a close-knit team of six engineers. I organized weekly C# and Java training classes to improve coding and debugging skills. We improved our productivity by 25%.<h3></p>
					<p><h3>Currently, I am seeking a senior level Quality Assurance Engineer role where I can contribute my 13 years of experience in problem solving and organization to your company.<h3><p>
