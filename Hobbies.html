		<p> <h1>I am a competitive person. I always try to improve myself.<h1></p>
		<p> <h2> I play tennis on the weekends. My tennis idol is Roger Federer.<h2></p>
		<p>Tennis is a game of strategy and pacing. I have to constantly watch and read my opponent's reaction. When something is not working, I have to change my strategy.
		I often record myself practicing tennis and swimming to see how I can improve.This is the way I am at work too.</p>

		<p> I can swim breaststroke or freestyle continuously for one hour at a steady pace. My next challenge is to better my technique in the butterfly stroke. As of now I can only swim 2 laps of butterfly before I have to rest. </p>
